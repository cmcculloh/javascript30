# javascript30

The purpose of this repo is as a sandbox for me to go through [Wes Bos's Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

_However_, whereas he wants you to focus on _just vanilla JavaScript/CSS/HTML_, that's what I've primarily been doing for the last 4 years. So, what I'm going to do is throw the kitchen sink at each and every one of these projects as I go. Which means, each one will have be done with some fancy modern JS library (React+Redux/SvelteKit) and written TypeScript _and_ should have some sort of unit testing.
